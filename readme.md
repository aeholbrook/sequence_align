Hello! 

I made a major mistake with PAM matrices when I wrote the program to calculate them, so I was up the majority of the night rewatching the video lecture you posted until I could figure it out. Unfortunately, I could not, and so I'm going to have to call it and turn in some unfinished code. I wrote this all in Jupyter so I could mess with the multiple modules, but unfortunately I didn't give myself the time to switch it over to this version. I would be happy to turn in my jupyter code, too, if you'll accept it. 

Run the __main__.py file through command prompt/terminal to get started. Right now, the PAM-n doesn't work because I couldn't get the right matrix output out of it (I think I've been doing something wrong with the f_j term, because I spit out the correct PAM-250 and I have the right formula otherwise.)

I totally spent way too long working on the pam-n issue and as such ran out of time to troubleshoot some other aspects of the program. There's not much error handling, so if it abruptly closes it's probably from a syntax error.

I'll turn something less buggy in tomorrow. I need to get some sleep and I wanna throw in the towel for the night.
