Hello! 

Run the __main__.py file through command prompt/terminal to get started. Right now, the PAM-n doesn't work because I couldn't get the right matrix output out of it. You should add whatever sequences you'd like to align as txt files in the "seq" folder. I will rework this soon to accept files in FASTA format but right now it doesn't like anything other than a sequence in the file.
